# Mods that we cannot update due to reasons

- Dungeon Crawl (1.16.3-2.2.4)
  - Custom dungeon overhaul, incompatible with our custom dungeons
- Project: Vibrant Journeys (1.16.5-3.2.10)
  - New biomes, maybe it'll cause ugly chunk borders
- Trofers (1.16.5-1.1.0)
  - Large overhaul of how Trofers function, incompatible with the Trofers we give as rewards.
