#### [Repurposed Structures v3.2.1 (1.16.5 MC)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/repurposed-structures/files/3429489)

(V.3.2.1 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)

Configs:

Fixed config values not properly working for changing size of RS Mineshafts, RS Fortresses, and RS Strongholds structures. Should be working correctly now.

Added configs to allow changing of RS Villages size. Note, you will need to re-add the changes you have done to RS Village config for spawnrates if you edit it before.

Renamed netherStrongholdSizeSH and endStrongholdSizeSH configs entries to netherStrongholdSize and endStrongholdSize.

(V.3.2.0 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)

Loot Tables:

Added special "bonus_rolls" pool to all RS's structure loot! If you have a mod that gives you the luck attribute or luck status effect, you may start to see certain kinds of new items in RS's chests! Especially new banner designs! Every RS Structure has a unique banner so get a mod or datapack that gives you luck and start collecting all the banners! See what you can find when you are lucky!

Mineshafts:

Harshly nerfed the rates of Minecarts in all RS Mineshafts as it was spawning too many Minecarts.

Mansions:

Fixed Snowy, Desert, and Birch Mansions using the wrong loot table or had the wrong loot table path in the chests.

All RS Mansions storage room chests may contain loot, make the dirt room chest have loot, and fixed a non-moisturized farmland block for farm room.

Pyramids:

Added a secret extra chest to End Pyramids that will have loot based on luck. (The other chest's loot are generated automatically at creation due to the Comparator blocks)

Igloos:

Fixed Stone Igloo basement chest not using the right loot table file.

Configs:

Fixed typos in 2 of the default values in the allowDimensions config entry.

lang:

Corrected two entries in the ru_ru.json lang file (Thank you DrHesperus!)

(V.3.1.3 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)

Major:

Fixed ANOTHER serverside crash due to clientsided code called. RS should be stable now hopefully and I ran it on server to make double sure.

(V.3.1.2 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)

Major:

Fixed Dolphin mixin crashing because I screw up again in my rush to release a fix aaaaaa

(V.3.1.1 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)

Major:

Fixed serverside crash when generating End Mineshafts and End Strongholds. Sorry about that!

Mansions:

All RS Mansions spawnrate default config value has been changed to make them much less common and better spaced out in the world. The old config values will not change when updating so either delete the RS Mansions config file or edit the rates yourself to be around 225.

Pyramids:

Fed Dolphins have a 24% chance of leading the player to an Ocean Pyramid!

Hard nerfed the Enchanted Golden Apple rates for End Pyramids.

Temples:

Removed chance of spawning Enderman spawners in Warped Nether Temples.

Soul Nether Temple and Warped Nether Temple now only have 1 mob spawners instead of 2.

Warped Nether Temple now has 2 hidden puzzle chests instead of 1.

Igloos:

Grassy Igloos will now utilize the surface blocks of biomes it is in. So if the Grassy Igloo is added to a modded biome with their own custom grass block, the Grassy Igloo will be made of that modded block now to blend in better!

Misc:

Fixed potential problems that could arise internally in code if user is using Turkish language settings. (Java's toUpperCase/toLowerCase infamous interaction with Turkish)

Fixed a possible crash if trying to spawn spawn certain structure pieces by Jigsaw Blocks manually placed by players. Worldgen was safe. This is just a rare edge case scenario 99.9% of people won't know about lol.

(V.3.1.0 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)

Mod Compat:

Fixed using the wrong path for importing End Remastered's loot into RS's structures chests.

Strongholds:

Added End Strongholds! Super rare and only spawns on within islands beyond 8000 blocks of the center of the End Dimension! You better bring your Elytra as the entrance is actually not on the surface but underside! But beware! It is very dangerous and massive to explore! And it also seems... off somehow... Can you figure out what is strange about it?
