2.11.1-163 (22 Mar 2021)

Updates

* API note: the PneumaticCraft API is now licensed under the LGPLv3 (previous GPLv3)
* - Intention is to allow any mod to link against the API and not worry about needing to license under the GPL. All open source mods welcome!
* Charging Station now gets a boost in charging speed when pressure > 15 bar
* - Up to 2x faster at 20 bar
* - This is over and above any Speed Upgrade speed boosts
* Slight change in Pneumatic Armor behaviour: all upgrade features now require a minimum of 0.1 bar pressure to operate
* - Armor itself still provides protection when out of pressure
* The methods of obtaining Memory Essence (Memory Stick / Aerial Interface) are now shown in JEI
* The Redstone Module can now act like a vanilla Comparator when in input mode, measuring the contents of the inventory it faces
* - Advanced PCB required for this; select "Comparator Mode" via the module GUI

Fixes

* Fixed startup crash when CoFH Core (Thermal series) 1.2.0 is installed
* - Will start up when older CoFH Core (1.1.6), but 1.2.0 is required for the Holding enchantment to boost the volume of pressurizable items
* Fixed not being able to toggle off Pneumatic Armor upgrades when out of air
* - Can now toggle upgrades off (but not back on) when the armor piece has insufficient pressure
* Fixes problem of running out of air with Jet Boots and then being unable to jump without taking boots off
* Fixed some messy text formatting in Universal Sensor GUI, sensor info tab
* Fixed stacked Air Canisters acting as an infinite air source under some circumstances
* - Air Canisters may now only stack if completely empty (no NBT), for ease of use as a crafting component
* Fixed Refinery GUI temperature tooltip showing nonsense ranges when there's no oil in the Refinery
* Fixed neighboring Pressure Tube block shapes not getting updated client-side when a tube explodes due to overpressure
* Fixed Electrostatic Compressor not always finding all connected compressors if the grid is large
