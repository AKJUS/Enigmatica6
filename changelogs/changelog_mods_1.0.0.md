An update after a long time...

Worked on some ingame docs, theyre not completely done, but at least most the entries are there...

* Pulled in a merge request for better harvester api compat, for agricraft mod i think...
* Added a filter tool + filter interaction to clear filters (similar to clearing fluid tanks with the upgrade tool)
* Added the render augment, which has its own in world crafting recipe, and can disable the render of items / upgrades in the pedestal
* 'Fixed' a dupe bug, basically tank upgrades cannot be inserted into pedestals if the items in the pedestal dont match the items in the tank.
* Added Bows as insertable tools
* disabled the smart crafter, removed its recipes too, and the crafting pattern as well.
