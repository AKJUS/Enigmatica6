This update addresses some minor issues and adds compatibility for Quark's vertical slabs. (Thank you to Vazkii for personally contributing those, I certainly wasn't going to get around to it any time soon)

CHANGES:

* Sunstone and Moonstone have had their light updates adjusted to perform better in high quantities.In addition, their timing has been adjusted such that their low power states overlap for a short time.
* Plating has received a new double slab texture
* Added slabs and stairs for Entrails
* Added Vertical Slabs for every existing slab block, for now they require Quark to be installed in order to enable them, this may change to include a config later.
* Removed the tile entity and excessive block updates from charged Chiseled Abyssaline
* Added a new recipe for Charcoal Blocks; putting Logs into a Smoker.

LOCALIZATION:

* Added Spanish translations by ph0elyx
* Added Italian translation by simcrafter
* Added Portuguese translation by CerbTheOne

Note - The latter two translations were written before the addition of Quark's vertical slabs. These names are untranslated.

#### [Chunk Pregenerator-V1.16-3.1.0](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/chunkpregenerator/files/3419304)

Major Chunk Pregenerator patches.

Reworked Pregenerator logic to fix issues that were reported.

Changelog:

Version 3.1.0:

* Fixed: Gui Commands can now set the Z Offset and actually make use of it.
* Changed: Retrogen generators are now sorted by Mod & Name (first by modname and then by name with their mod)
* Changed: Selecting a Retrogenerator with shift will enable/disable all of them.
* Fixed: Retrogening no longer crashes because the actual required world space is loaded.
* Removed: Aggressive Pregeneration Config got removed and is now Enforced since its more useful.
* Fixed: Light Enginer worker now processes Region Files in the same order as Terrain Engine Worker. (Light engine did random order of what terrain finished)
* Changed: Light Engine now only processes 1 region file at once. This slows it down a tiny bit but not by much.
* Added: If the WorldGenerator gets stuck by any reason the Pregenerator now interrupts the worldgenerator and restarts it. Not 100% reliable but if the worldgenerator just needs a restart that will fix 90% of the issues.
* Fixed: Prepare Process now calculates all numbers correct.
* Added: Config for disabling Special Command Arguments removing the requirements for the Client by Default. (Can be enabled if wanted but requires a server restart or command reload)
* Added: (Disabled by default) WorldGenerator hack that is basically enabling Multithreaded WorldGeneration and allows to use more cores. Disabled by default because its crash potential is deemed to high for to be enabled by default. Its perfectly save to use in terms of "Not causing corruption" its just that some worldgeneration seeds still crash with this.
* Fixed: Reported bugs and maybe a couple things i dont remember out of the head. (it was a long development cycle)

### [Citadel](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/citadel) ([citadel-1.7.2-1.16.5](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/citadel/files/3390028)⟶[citadel-1.7.3-1.16.5](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/citadel/files/3414574))

#### [Repurposed Structures v3.1.3 (1.16.5 MC)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/repurposed-structures/files/3424171)

(V.3.1.3 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)

Major:

Fixed ANOTHER serverside crash due to clientsided code called. RS should be stable now hopefully and I ran it on server to make double sure.

(V.3.1.2 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)

Major:

Fixed Dolphin mixin crashing because I screw up again in my rush to release a fix aaaaaa

(V.3.1.1 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)

Major:

Fixed serverside crash when generating End Mineshafts and End Strongholds. Sorry about that!

Mansions:

All RS Mansions spawnrate default config value has been changed to make them much less common and better spaced out in the world. The old config values will not change when updating so either delete the RS Mansions config file or edit the rates yourself to be around 225.

Pyramids:

Fed Dolphins have a 24% chance of leading the player to an Ocean Pyramid!

Hard nerfed the Enchanted Golden Apple rates for End Pyramids.

Temples:

Removed chance of spawning Enderman spawners in Warped Nether Temples.

Soul Nether Temple and Warped Nether Temple now only have 1 mob spawners instead of 2.

Warped Nether Temple now has 2 hidden puzzle chests instead of 1.

Igloos:

Grassy Igloos will now utilize the surface blocks of biomes it is in. So if the Grassy Igloo is added to a modded biome with their own custom grass block, the Grassy Igloo will be made of that modded block now to blend in better!

Misc:

Fixed potential problems that could arise internally in code if user is using Turkish language settings. (Java's toUpperCase/toLowerCase infamous interaction with Turkish)

Fixed a possible crash if trying to spawn spawn certain structure pieces by Jigsaw Blocks manually placed by players. Worldgen was safe. This is just a rare edge case scenario 99.9% of people won't know about lol.

(V.3.1.0 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)

Mod Compat:

Fixed using the wrong path for importing End Remastered's loot into RS's structures chests.

Strongholds:

Added End Strongholds! Super rare and only spawns on within islands beyond 8000 blocks of the center of the End Dimension! You better bring your Elytra as the entrance is actually not on the surface but underside! But beware! It is very dangerous and massive to explore! And it also seems... off somehow... Can you figure out what is strange about it?

Bastions:

Buffed Underground Bastion loot a bit more and added "bonus_roll" to more of their loot tables. If you have increased Luck attribute (usually from another mod), you may find increased loot in Underground Bastion's chests.

Wandering Traders will now have a rare chance to sell a map to an Underground Bastion.

Dungeons:

In End Dungeons, Shulker Boxes now won't try and spawn on top of Shulker Boxes or turn the below Shulker Box into a Pig Spawner.

Shripwrecks:

Crimson, Warped, and Nether Bricks Shipwreck's spawnrate default config value has been changed to make them significantly more common. The old config values will not change when updating so either delete the RS Shipwreck config file or edit the rates yourself to be 27 or 29.

Ruins:

Made the default config value for Hot Land Ruins and Warm Land Ruins higher so those ruins are a bit more rare. The old config values will not change when updating so either delete the RS Ruins config file or edit the rates yourself to be 42 or 45.

Mansions:

If RS Mansions are turned off in the spawnrate configs, they will remove their map trades from Cartographers.

Fortresses:

If Jungle Fortresses are turned off in the spawnrate configs, they will remove their map trades from Cartographers.

Increased maximum config value allowed for Jungle Fortresses size up to 30.

Fixed vertical range config for Jungle Fortresses not actually applying when changed.

Mineshafts:

Increased maximum config value allowed for RS Mineshaft size up to 30.

(V.3.0.4 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)

Pyramids:

Restrict y range for the Bubble Column processor so that Ocean Pyramids do not crash if it tries to spawn below y = 0 or above y = 255.

(V.3.0.3 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)

Optimization:

#### [supplementaries-1.16.5-0.15.2b.jar](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/supplementaries/files/3424380)

v 0.15.2b:

* Fixed a simple but deadly bug that slipped in undetected last update that prevented mod setup from running correctly on servers which intern made it so structures weren't getting registered, which made chunks not save and load at all. Took me quite a bit to narrow this down so that's why the late update. Apologies if it messed up anybodys world. I made some changes that will allow me to spot an issue like this before releasing so shouldn't happen agai and even if it did it should still at least let the world save thanks to some fail safe code I added.
* Fixed modded sconces not working correctly

* Removed blackboard clearing recipe in favor of its manual counterpart using either a sponge or inspirations cauldron (or create washing)
* Blackboards now show a preview in the item tooltip
* Added some additional configs
