### [Apotheosis](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/apotheosis) ([Apotheosis-1.16.4-4.5.3.jar](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/apotheosis/files/3312802)⟶[Apotheosis-1.16.4-4.6.0.jar](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/apotheosis/files/3314638))

#### [Apotheosis-1.16.4-4.6.0.jar](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/apotheosis/files/3314638)

Added the ability to upgrade affixes! Items with affixes that are combined with an affix tome containing the same affix will now result in an increased level of that affix, rather than just the highest level of the two. Tomes themselves can also be merged, allowing for creation of stronger affix tomes before application to an item.

On top of that, Splitting and Obliteration function on Affix Tomes as well! You are free to separate and level down your affixes to create the exact strength you desire.

Also, the bug where soul fire particles showed up beneath your feet is fixed, so that's good.

And to recap from 4.5.4, affixes are now far widely more applicable to items. Items specified via datapack will no longer check the item they are applied to, and manual overrides of an item's autodetected equipment type are now possible (in deadly.cfg). This means if you want to designate a stick as a sword, and let it receive sword affixes, you can!

#### [modular-routers-1.16.5-7.5.0-59.jar](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modular-routers/files/3315175)

7.5.0 (19 May 2021)

* New Upgrade: the Energy Upgrade!
* - Gives the router an internal energy buffer; each upgrade adds 50,000 FE capacity and 1,000 FE transfer per router tick
* - Can have up to 64 in a router
* New Modules: Energy Output and Energy Distributor!
* - Energy Output can push FE to an adjacent energy-receiving block
* - Energy Distributor can wirelessly push FE to up to 8 nearby energy-receiving blocks
* - Speed Upgrades increase transfer rate for these modules
* Modules can now be configured to require FE to run (on a per-module basis)
* - See "Energy Costs" section in modularrouters-common.toml
* - All modules have a default cost of 0 FE, as before (but see Activator Module changes below)
* - Could be useful for modpack makers, e.g. for expert-level packs
* Activator Module now has an "Attack Entity" mode!
* - Router will use the item in the buffer (or empty hand) to attack nearby entities
* - This costs FE by default: 150 FE per attack
* - Speed Upgrades will speed up attacks, BUT weapon cooldowns still apply so don't overuse Speed Upgrades!
* - A Security Upgrade will protect the owner and any whitelisted players from being attacked
* Routers are now called "Modular Router" in-game instead of "Item Router"
* - Since they can handle more than just items...
* - Internal registry name is still modularrouters:item_router, so no compat problems for existing worlds; this is just a cosmetic change
* Breaker and Extruder Mk1 modules will now drop XP orbs if the block being broken drops XP (as various ores do)
* - Can be disabled in config if previous behaviour is preferred: see blockBreakXPDrops
* Fixed GUI's getting locked up if another player breaks a router while a GUI is open
* Fixed missing recipe for the Filter Round Robin Augment
* Fixed sneak-right-clicking Sync Upgrade displaying the previous sync value, not the new one
* Inspection Filter: return -1 for "missing" properties instead of 0
* - e.g. for durability tests, a durability of <1% returns 0, but an item without durability (e.g. Cobblestone) returns -1
* - this fixes a problem where nearly broken items couldn't be distinguished from items without durability
* A few Activator Module raytracing tweaks for more intuitive use of Above & Below look modes
* - In particular, routers can now plant things on top of a solid block next to or above the router with Look Above mode
* - In 7.4.0 this required Look Below and only worked for blocks horizontally adjacent, which was very unintuitive
* Lots of updates to the Patchouli manual to reflect new and updated functionality

#### [pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.16.5-2.12.4-188.jar](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/pneumaticcraft-repressurized/files/3315269)
