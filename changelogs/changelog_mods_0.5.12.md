### [Macaw's Windows](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/macaws-windows) ([ [1.0.3 / 1.16.5/4] Macaw's Windows](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/macaws-windows/files/3200515)⟶[[2.0.0 / 1.16.5] Macaw's Windows](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/macaws-windows/files/3443597))

#### [[2.0.0 / 1.16.5] Macaw's Windows](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/macaws-windows/files/3443597)

Changed:

* Windows now have a full hitbox when opened, projectiles can still go through it.

* When you right click with a hammer, the windows state will toggle to the basic 1x1,

which can be useful if don't want your windows to connect all the way up.

* Everything attached to the block you are aiming will toggle on right click, meaning

you can toggle multiple blinds/windows by one click.

* Improved the texture for the two window items, so you can better see them using JEI
* Renamed Bar windows to Grille windows

Removed:

* Tall Blocks, they are no longer needed since from now on you can just stack up the

window to any size you want.

* Fix SingleItemHandler not allowing hopper input beyond 1 item

Models

* Added MantleItemLayerModel (registered as mantle:item_layer). Improves the vanilla item layer by adding a non-tint color option, a no tint option, and a luminosity option. Can be used by other loaders (e.g. tinkers tool model) to add tinted and luminosity elements
* Ported NBTKeyModel (registered as mantle:nbt_key) from Tinkers. Allows a model to switch between a set of textures based on a string tag in NBT, plus more variants can be registered
* Added ColoredBlockModel (registered as mantle:colored_block). Allows non-tint colors and luminosity to be set for block style models

#### [MmmMmmMmmMmm-1.16.5-1.3.0.jar](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mmmmmmmmmmmm/files/3468637)

* Dummies can now detect and react to damage that bypasses armor. Such damage is now grouped in the "true damage" category and marked in a purple color.

This fixes compatibility with many mods that deal damage in such a way, and also prevents the dummy to die from such attacks.

* Added a config option to disable durability damage to melee items used to attack a dummy. This means that you will no longer need to repair your items when testing your dps.
* Improved dummy ai to hopefully react to more damage sources
* Updated dummy item texture
* Added a new Minecraft Dungeons themed skin

Fixes

* Hotfix: fix server crash related to changes made in 2.14.3 with Amadron villager trade scanning
* Appears to be an unexpected interaction between Quark and/or Terraforged

2.14.3-257 (23rd Sep 2021)

Updates

* Added the ability to filter Amadron offers by the player's location, intended for modpack makers
* This allows for certain offers only to be available in certain places
* Filtering can be by whitelist or blacklist, and by dimension ID's and/or biome categories
* No existing offers are filtered by default
* See [https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/wiki/Amadron-and-Datapacks](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/wiki/Amadron-and-Datapacks) for more info
* Added drones_can_be_picked_up config setting (default is true, following previous behaviour)
* If set to false, nothing will be able to pick drones up (boats, minecarts or any other entity)
* Added an "Interpolate Threshold" redstone mode for the UV Lightbox
* In this mode, the completion threshold percentage is 25 + (signal_level * 5)
* Threshold cannot be manually adjusted in this mode
* A signal of 0 in this mode disables processing (so effective range 30% to 100% in increments of 5)
* Added Stonecutter recipes for the various Reinforced Stone blocks
* Added $deploy_pos special Drone variable
* This returns the blockpos at which the drone was deployed
* For Programmable Controller, it returns the blockpos at which the controller was placed

Fixes

* Fixed slider widgets holding onto a mouse drag if mouse button released while not over the widget in question
* Prevent machine pressures rising to silly levels if machine has a Security Upgrade but is receiving air faster than it can vent it
* Pressure now clamped to machine's critical level (7 or 25 bar)
* Fixed GPS Tool '+' and '-' buttons messing up the numeric value
* Another artifact of the switch to Mojang mappings in 2.14.0 (a method name got mixed up)
* Fixed server crash when Smart Chest tries to push items into a Blood Altar under certain circumstances
* Fixed villager house generation ignoring the addMechanicHouse config setting
* Fixed Pneumatic Door in "wooden door" or "iron door" mode not opening on world load even if signal present (until block update received)
* Fixed Pneumatic Door in "nearby and looking" mode requiring all nearby players to be looking at the door
* Only one player needs to be looking at the door

### [Repurposed Structures (Forge)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/repurposed-structures) ([Repurposed Structures v3.2.1 (1.16.5 MC)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/repurposed-structures/files/3429489)⟶[Repurposed Structures v3.2.5 (1.16.5 MC)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/repurposed-structures/files/3469414))

#### [Repurposed Structures v3.2.5 (1.16.5 MC)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/repurposed-structures/files/3469414)

(V.3.2.5 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)

Misc:

Fixed crash if trying to use Java 11+ with this 1.16.5 Forge Repurposed Structures (forgot to do @mutable on an accessor mixin)

Igloos:

Grassy Igloo will no longer replace its blocks with air or fluid blocks if the biome's surfacebuilder uses air or fluid blocks.

Mineshafts:

Fixed crash if End Mineshaft is attempted to be spawned in a dimension where terrain reaches down to world bottom.

(V.3.2.4 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)

Misc:

Fixed a memory leak from the processor used on Grassy Igloos. The leak only happens if you keep finding Grassy Igloos. Special thanks to BlueAmulet for catching this leak.

(V.3.2.3 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)

Mod compat:

Turned off the surrounding biome checks for RS structures when the Hexlands II mod is on. This will prevent using /locate or explorer maps on Jungle Fortress from freezing the game since there isn't a big enough area of jungle to pass the original checks. Now all RS structures should spawn when Hexlands II mod is on and active. [https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hexlands-ii](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hexlands-ii)

(V.3.2.2 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)

Mineshafts:

End Mineshafts now will try to spawn within islands a bit better. The minY and maxY config for End Mineshafts was deleted in favor of endMineshaftMinIslandThickness config entry. The End Mineshaft config default value for spawnrate was bumped up to 60 due to the new more restrictive terrain checks.

Dungeons:

Slightly lowered Ocean Dungeons default config value for spawn attempts per chunk from 5 to 4.

Shipwrecks:

Crimson, Warped, and Nether Bricks Shipwreck's spawnrate default config value has been changed to make them even more common. The old config values will not change when updating so either delete the RS Shipwreck config file or edit the rates yourself to be 18 or 19.

End Shipwrecks treasure chest cannot have more than 1 Elytra and the Elytra is now more rare (from ~1/17 chance to now 1/20)

Increased chances of a lucky banner from End Shipwreck's map chest.

Strongholds:

Nether Strongholds library chest cannot have more than 1 kind of explorer map at a time now.

Ruined Portals:

End Ruined Portals chests cannot ever have more than 1 End City explorer map in a single chest.

Loot Tables:

Explorer maps in the RS structures now only have zoom level 2 or 1 to massively speed up creation of these maps in chests. This is most noticeable with the explorer maps created in the End themed RS structures. May even prevent servers from stalling.

Changed the explorer maps in the RS structures to no longer skip existing chunks for finding structures. This means maps may locate structures that you already found before but this should reduce the lag on pre-generated servers. By now checking already generated chunks, maps should load much faster from RS's loot blocks. If you wish for the maps to find unexplored structures again, download the loot table datapack from here: [https://github.com/TelepathicGrunt/RepurposedStructures-Fabric/releases/tag/0.0.11](https://github.com/TelepathicGrunt/RepurposedStructures-Fabric/releases/tag/0.0.11) Then change "skip_existing_chunks": false to "skip_existing_chunks": true for all minecraft:exploration_map entries.

Cleaned up the lucky banner pools in RS loot tables so that it is 100% vanilla now and the updated loot table datapack can work on servers without RS on.

Removed treasure enchant possibilities for tools in many non-End RS loot tables for better balance. (Mending is a treasure enchantment for example)

(V.3.2.1 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)

Configs:

Fixed config values not properly working for changing size of RS Mineshafts, RS Fortresses, and RS Strongholds structures. Should be working correctly now.

Added configs to allow changing of RS Villages size. Note, you will need to re-add the changes you have done to RS Village config for spawnrates if you edit it before.

Renamed netherStrongholdSizeSH and endStrongholdSizeSH configs entries to netherStrongholdSize and endStrongholdSize.

(V.3.2.0 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)

Loot Tables:

Added special "bonus_rolls" pool to all RS's structure loot! If you have a mod that gives you the luck attribute or luck status effect, you may start to see certain kinds of new items in RS's chests! Especially new banner designs! Every RS Structure has a unique banner so get a mod or datapack that gives you luck and start collecting all the banners! See what you can find when you are lucky!

Mineshafts:

Harshly nerfed the rates of Minecarts in all RS Mineshafts as it was spawning too many Minecarts.

Mansions:

Fixed Snowy, Desert, and Birch Mansions using the wrong loot table or had the wrong loot table path in the chests.

All RS Mansions storage room chests may contain loot, make the dirt room chest have loot, and fixed a non-moisturized farmland block for farm room.

Pyramids:

Added a secret extra chest to End Pyramids that will have loot based on luck. (The other chest's loot are generated automatically at creation due to the Comparator blocks)

Igloos:

Fixed Stone Igloo basement chest not using the right loot table file.

Configs:

Fixed typos in 2 of the default values in the allowDimensions config entry.

### [Resourceful Bees](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/resourceful-bees) ([ResourcefulBees-1.16.5-0.6.7.2b](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/resourceful-bees/files/3281371)⟶[Resourceful Bees 1.16.5-0.9.9.6](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/resourceful-bees/files/3461633))

please continue to report any bugs/issues to [https://issues.resourcefullbees.com/](https://issues.resourcefullbees.com/)

----- [0.9.9.6] -----

* Fixed hive ingredient crashing servers, closing #283

----- [0.9.9.5] -----

* Changed how the apiary recipe works to allow for upgraded hives and nests that have been upgraded with a hive upgrade item.
* Added a recipe to empty honey generators
* Fixed the manual centrifuge not respecting bottle output count, therefore closing #274
* Fixed #280 by updating the item handler on load instead of only on upgrade change.
* Fixed #266 Updated the apiary breeder to only update processes when a slot has changed, still requires a change in the future to not be called as much but reduces it to be called a lot less than every tick. and as precaution I kept the check when its about to process to check again just in case if it didn't update correctly.
* Fixed the conversion recipes to duplicating buckets. Closes #257

----- [0.9.9.4] -----

* stacked filled bee jars (i.e. ones you get from mutations and quests) no longer clear all nbt data when you spawn a bee with them, it will now just decrease the stack size.
* added "isInvulnerable" option to CombatData
* removed unnessacary validApiary block and item tags (we forgot to remove them when we changed how apiaries are validated, you can still use the tag to add blocks to apiaries, that hasn't been removed)

----- [0.9.9.3] -----

* Changed Entity to Entity mutations in JEI to show the entity model rather than a spawnegg, this should hopefully remove a lot of confusion. (The beepedia still shows entity models like always)

----- [0.9.9.2] -----

* Fixed an edge case crash when mutationData isn't added to the bee json
* Removed particles from Ender Beecon effects. (This should fix issue with performance when a beecon is granting a lot of effects to bees)

----- [0.9.9.1] -----

* Fixed an issue where you couldn't start a server with resourcefulbees
* fixed default icy bee not spawning

----- [0.9.9] -----

* Fixed an issue where centrifuge input counts weren't respected.
* Added Honey Glass. (Glass which allows only players or only bees to pass through)
* Added a texture for creative beepedia.
* Added angry dungeon bee texture.
* Added a Yeti Dev Bee.
* Made it so that apiaries don't require a floor and now check for if a block has collision for if it's a valid block.
* Valid apiary blocks using hasCollision check now have the tag added to their items. (This will allow you to search for it in JEI)
* Fixed Item Mutations outputting items with a blank nbt tag.
* Bees can be parents in a breed without needing to have a self breed option. (isBreedable is false but has feed item)
* Added lore options to bees in JEI and Beepedia.
* Added 2 new models Yeti Horns and Guardian Spikes.
* Fixed layer textures not loading properly when defined with a preceding /

----- [0.6.7.2b] -----

* Fixed an error trying to process bee damage immunities, in doing so we actually added the ability for all damage sources including modded ones to be allowed.

----- [0.6.7.1b] -----

* Fixed a crash when attempting to breed bees with no feed return item

----- [0.6.7b] -----

* Added Spider trait, this trait allows bees to pass through spider webs without being slowed.
* Changed default bees to use various types of flowers
* Updated chinese translation
* Added Bottomless Honey Pot, this block allows for voiding of honey with ease.
* Added 7 more patreon reward textures.
* Added the ability for each bee to have their apiary output types set individually (e.g. "apiaryOutputTypes" : ["COMB", "COMB", "BLOCK", "COMB"],)
* Mutations that result or use a bee will now show up in the beepedia breeding tab of that bee
* Spawn egg item mutations will now show up in the beepedia breeding tab of that bee

*

Added flower and hive positions for bees to TOP display

* Blazing bone tools now render fullbright
* Fix material registry not syncing to players on LAN worlds
* Fix bloodbone repair item using the wrong fluid to cast
* Fix mob pathing around table blocks. If any blocks still have weird pathing let me know as its hard to catch them all

Modifiers

* Pathing, stripping, and tilling now work on durability hand-held tools instead of harvest

World

* Terracubes now drop bricks if killed while one fire

* Netherite frames are immune to explosions
* Fix shurikens causing the player to move faster when thrown

Book

* Added content to Tinkers' Gadgetry about world and gadgets added by Tinkers. Should cover everything except slimeboots and EFLN, as both are subject to major changes in the next couple alphas
* Updated blazing blood section in Fantastic Foundry with head melting and piglin bartering
* Encyclopedia now states the ideal damage amount to deal for max fluid output from melting
* Correct book descriptions about tools that start with piercing
* Fix typo on the blasting page

API
