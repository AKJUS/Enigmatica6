2.15.4-312 (14th Mar 2022)

Updates

Fixes

* When breaking a Spawner with a Spawner Agitator attached, Spawner player activation range is now reset

* External Program wrongly interpreted the end of the foreach subroutine as end of the entire subprogram
* Fixed External Program widget running forever

* Previously the Tag Filter had to be in the second slot, now it can be in either
* Fixed a possible server-side crash related to placing heat-using blocks
* Not one I could reproduce myself, but extra defensive coding has been added to ensure a crash is impossible in these circumstances
* NOTE: this does require an API break in the HeatBehaviour API class; generics are no longer used or required here

* Players now have a higher drop rate of heads from severing, making it possible to get 100% drop rate with the right modifiers
* Interaction modifiers such as tilling and pathing now use cobalt instead of netherite scrap in the recipe
* Allow creating seared reinforcement using scorched stone, for nether runs
* Looting on chestplates is now an upgrade, and now properly requires unarmed to make it more clear it only affects unarmed attacks
* Make autosmelt recipe a bit cheaper, making it possible with overworld resources
* Fix toolbelt having a max of level 1

Smeltery

* Discourage mobs from pathfinding into an active smeltery or foundry
* Cast chest can now be crafted using any cast type. This is more consistent with the recipe in 1.18, where blank casts no longer exist
* Add recipes for casting magma using blazing blood and slime

World

* Fix skyslime grass on ender dirt having the wrong texture
* Fix trapdoor textures orienting wrongly when opened

Books

* Improve page for repair kits
* Fix some typos in books

Data

* Added timers to data loaders to keep track of how fast they load
* Make model caches concurrent, I am told some performance mod causes a crash if they are not concurrent, and its a trivial fix
* Make modifier recipes support stackable tinker tools. We don't use this feature internally, but an addon requested it
* Tool stat JSON have better merging logic across multiple datapacks. Now instead of needing to provide all stats, you only need to provide the ones you change. For example, you can change the harvest level of a material without being forced to override its durability, attack damage, and mining speed
* Make texture scanners less likely to fail if the order of resource loading changes
