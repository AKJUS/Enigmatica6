------------------------------------------------------

Version 3.1.1

------------------------------------------------------

* Fixed the Throwing Daggers so that they act as the appropriate type.
* Fixed the Sigil of Magnetism's range so that it is centered on the player.
* Fixed the Living Armour upgrade "Tough" so that it is now obtainable. Now you can get hurt for an actual cause!
* Fixed an NPE crash due to the Ritual of Living Evolution. Crash occurred if a player equipped a newly crafted Living Armour set while on the activated ritual.
* Changed the behaviour of the Living Upgrade Tomes.

-> Tomes now will attempt to apply their contained EXP (not levels) regardless of current or tome levels.

-> If exp from tome would put you pass the armour's point cap, exp is instead added up to the maximum possible for said Living Upgrade minus one.

-> Exp applied to the Living Armour is syphoned from the tome, and the remaining exp is not lost.

-> If the remaining exp on the Living Upgrade tome is below the amount required for at least one level of its respective upgrade, the tome is destroyed.

* Waterlogged blocks now count as "water" for the Incense Altar.
* Added the recipe for the Demon Will Aura Gauge.
* Reverted capacity formula for the Blood Altar.
* Fixed duplication glitch for the Alchemical Reaction Chamber.

2.13.2-205 (19 Jul 2021)

New

* New block: Creative Compressed Iron Block
* - This creative-only block maintains a constant temperature, similar to how the Creative Compressor maintains a constant pressure

Updates

* Significant internal refactoring of Pneumatic Armor upgrade handling
* - No player-visible updates, but a fair bit of code cleanup & optimisation has been done
* Entity filter: @mob will no longer match tamed mobs
* - While there aren't any tameable mobs in vanilla, other mods can add them, e.g. tamed Quark's Foxhounds are now safe from your Sentry Turrets & Guard Drones

Fixes

* Fixed bug where PNC Fluid Tanks would push any fluid into a Memory Stick, treating it as XP
* Items in a Pressure Chamber no longer render too dark
* Fixed Air Compressors running with no fuel when Advent of Ascension is also installed
* - This is actually an AoA bug where empty itemstacks end up with a fuel value, but I've added extra checks in PNC to prevent this happening
* Fixed Programmer only using/returning Puzzle Pieces for a single item when writing a program to a stack of multiple Network API items
* Fixed right-clicking slots to split stacks not working in the Programmer GUI

(V.3.0.1 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)

Fortresses:

Jungle Fortresses end pieces now can spawn decoration properly

Nerfed rate of Drowned in Jungle Fortresses a bit

Pyramids:

Fixed Bubble Columns in Ocean Pyramids not fully creating their column after pyramid generation

Prevent Ocean Pyramids from generating above sealevel. Instead, they may be entirely buried below sealevel if the land is above sealevel.

Ruins:

Removed the random Grass Block that Hot Land Ruins spawned by mistake

Fixed Dead Bush not generating in side pieces of Hot Land Ruins

Fixed Tall Grass not generating in side pieces of Warm Land Ruins

Bastions:

Added Stonebricks layer to bottom of Unit and Stables giant rooms in Underground Bastions to reduce chances of it getting burned down by lava

Misc:

Changed versioning format in jar and jar name to match semantic versioning format

Improved error message from structures that can fail to spawn their pieces due to the height range being set to be too narrow in RS's configs.

(V.3.0.0 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)

Configs:

Heavily cleaned up and improved the configs. They now exist in config/repurposed_structures-forge folder

Fixed some structures and features not working with the dimension/biome configs correctly

Added configs to allow dimensional/biome allowing or disallowing much better!

Added configs to control natural mob spawning over time in structures!

Added ModdedLoot configs so users can turn off Repurposed Structures's modded loot importing system easier for its structures.

Mineshafts:

Fixed issue where the ending pieces of some Mineshafts won't have decorative blocks like vines or seagrass or minecarts

Pyramids:

Fixed Tropical Fish dying in Mushroom Pyramid's pit at generation

Mushroom Pyramid's pit is slightly adjusted to not be so cramped

Added Chains to Ocean Pyramids so the Drowned won't walk into the Magma Block and take damage

Ruins:

Adjusted looks of Warm Land Ruins so it doesn't look as bad as it was before

Wells:

All wells now use processor lists to randomize their chances of having ores or bells. The well's block tags and bell config entry have been deleted as they are no longer needed.

Increase default chance of Nether Wells spawning.

Wells are more likely to have a Bell now.

Advancements:

Forgot to add xp reward for several advancements.

Misc:

Cleaned up backend code. Might had introduced a bug or two. Please report the bugs you find!

Properly centered several structures so they match up with their land/water/terrain checks centered on the structure itself.

### [Valhelsia Structures](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/valhelsia-structures) ([Valhelsia Structures - 0.1.3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/valhelsia-structures/files/3367067)⟶[Valhelsia Structures - 0.1.4](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/valhelsia-structures/files/3396812))

#### [Valhelsia Structures - 0.1.4](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/valhelsia-structures/files/3396812)

Patch 0.1.4 (Bugfix Update):

* Fixed a potential crash ([Issue #88](https://github.com/ValhelsiaTeam/Valhelsia-Structures/issues/88)).

* Fixed the custom Dirt, Coarse Dirt, and Grass Blocks around structures breaking slowly regardless of tool used.

Patch 0.1.3 (Bugfix Update):

* Fixed "Missing Structure Start" log spam.
* Fixed Big Jars overwriting other blocks.

* Added wildcard support to biome blacklisting - you can now add an asterisk before or after text in the blacklist entries, such as "twilightforest*" (which would prevent structures generating in any Twilight Forest biomes).
* Structures will no longer spawn in water, even if it is a valid biome - this prevents structures appearing in the middle of lakes, for example.

Patch 0.1.2 (Bugfix Update):

* Fix Mixin log spam on server (and possible crash).
* Improve structure registration and placement checks (structures should generare more often now).
